            <p>Netflix no longer wants to support third-party apps for shared streaming. They want to design their own,
                native feature where users can start a host session, and invite friends to watch a show at the same
                time. This way, users won’t have to download third-party apps and be forced to trust other bootleg
                companies with their data. In addition, Netflix wants to discourage the sharing of accounts by multiple
                people, and wish to encourage subscription purchases by offering the feature only to those with their
                own, separate paid account.</p>

            <br>


            <h2>Script</h2>
            <p>We are asking you to try using a mobile app mock-up that we’ve created, to see whether or not it works as
                intended. We are not testing you, we are testing the design. Don’t worry about making mistakes, because
                if something in the design solution is confusing, it means that it is something we need to work on.</p>


            <p>As you walk through this, please try as much as possible to try and think out loud. Say what you’re
                looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. Don’t worry about hurting feelings, we
                are testing this design so we can see how to improve it, and need honest reactions. </p>


            <p> If you have any questions during the testing, please ask. This can include clarification, but I cannot
                explain the solution to any tasks. Do I have permission to record your responses via audio. </p>
            <br>

            <p> Any questions?</p>
            <br>

            <hr>

            <p> The following are the pre-test questions asked to the participants, to understand where they fell in
                terms of application and feature literacy. </p>

            <hr>

            <br>

            <h3>I will now ask you a few questions, and I would like you to answer honestly. If elaboration is needed, I
                will ask. You are allowed to ask for the question to be reworded, or repeated. </h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Do you use a lot of streaming apps? If so, how many, or which ones?</li>
                <li>Do you use any streaming apps to share streams between yourself and friends?</li>
                <li>Do you use third party applications to stream videos between you and your friends?</li>
                <li>On a scale of one to ten, how familiar would you consider yourself with streaming applications? One
                    being very unfamiliar and ten being very familiar.</li>
                <li>On a scale of one to ten, how familiar would you consider yourself with stream sharing applications
                    or features? One being very unfamiliar and ten being very familiar.</li>
                <li>When you use streaming services, do you usually use your mobile phone, a tablet, or a desktop
                    device?</li>
                <li>Between the streaming services who’s apps you use, which interface and interaction do you like the
                    most?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why?</li>
                </ul>
                <li>On a scale of one to ten, how familiar would you consider yourself with Netflix? One being very
                    unfamiliar and ten being very familiar.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> The following is the script and prompts for the tasks.</p>

            <hr>

            <br>

            <h3>We will now enter the testing phase. To provide some context for what you will be testing for us, I will
                provide a brief description of what we are presenting.</h3>

            <p>My partner and I are working on an additional feature to Netflix’s mobile app that allows for streaming
                content with your friends. It wouldn’t necessarily be screen sharing, but it would involve watching a
                show or movie at the same time as the people you connect with.</p>

            <p>Now, I will give you the prototype. Bear in mind that it is a low-fi prototype, so it is very basic and
                may not have all of the functionality you are expecting, but it has the features that are meant to be
                tested and interacted with.
            </p>

            <p>Just look at the screen, and tell me what you think of it. Does anything come out to you upon first
                glance? Possibly about what you can do, what you like, what you don’t like, what’s unusual, or what’s
                familiar. Just don’t click anything yet.</p>

            <p>I am now going to give you a task to do, and please do your best to complete them. Again, just think
                aloud as much as possible as you complete the task. To reiterate, you may ask any questions you want and
                take as much time as you want. <span>However, I cannot answer questions that would instruct you on how
                    to complete the task.</span> </p>


            <ul>
                <li>Please try and join a Stream Party from the home page.</li>
                <li>Now please exit the Stream Party queue.</li>
                <li>Join the stream party again, and we’ll wait a bit.</li>
                <li>Please leave the stream party session. </li>
                <li>Now please host a stream party.</li>
                <li>Please try and kick a user out of the participant queue, from the host stream party page.</li>
                <li>Please start the stream party.</li>
                <li><span>Please find a way to see the participants in your Stream Party.</span></li>
                <li>Please find a way to kick a user out of your current Stream Party. </li>
                <li>Please try and find a way to end the stream party.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <hr>

            <p> After this, the participants were asked some follow-up questions and reflective questions, to ask for
                opinion. Some additional questions that were off-script may have been asked since the testing was on an
                individual basis, so that an individual participant’s experience could be elaborated upon. </p>

            <hr>

            <br>

            <h3>This ends the tasks and testing! Thank you so much for participating. I will now ask a few questions as
                a follow up.</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Was there any task that you had trouble with?</li>
                <li>Do you have any suggestions for immediate improvements? </li>
                <li>Are there any questions for me?</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <hr>

            <p> Lastly, the participants were given a thank you and wrap up for participating.</p>

            <h2>Discussion</h2>

            <p>
                All participants said they used Netflix, and cited other streaming services such as HBO Max, Hulu,
                Amazon
                Prime, and AppleTV+. Most participants were very unfamiliar with using third-party applications to share
                streams, and did not use them. However, one participant said they used Netflix Party as a third party
                application, and another one mentioned the use of Shareplay for Facetime.
            </p>

            <p>
                Netflix was the most popularly cited streaming service that people used, with all participants saying
                they
                used it the most. Participants rated themselves high on the scale for familiarity with streaming service
                interfaces (between 7-8), but low for familiarity with stream sharing features (all scored 4 or less).
                Unfortunately, all participants said that they predominantly use the desktop websites to stream tv and
                movies, but on the plus side, rated themselves highly on familiarity with Netflix and it’s interface
                (8-10).
            </p>

            <p>
                The task that many had difficulty with was trying to join a Stream Party from the home page. There was a
                lot
                of time taken to find it in some cases, with one participant stating that the icon was difficult to
                find.
            </p>

            <p>
                “I first looked down to the bottom panel–like, scanned those buttons to check them out, and it did take
                me a
                little bit to find the little people button–because it is pretty little. But once I saw it, I knew that
                it
                was definitely the one.”
            </p>

            <p>
                On the plus side, this participant stated that the button’s function was clear once she found it.
                However,
                another participant thought differently.
            </p>

            <p>
                “It’s a little bit unclear which of these two buttons is the stream party, I’m gonna guess it’s the one
                with
                people on it and the other one is Airplay or something.”
            </p>

            <p>
                In terms of locating the participants tab, all participants found it fairly easy to figure out which
                button
                to click, because of the fact that the icon was consistent.
            </p>

            <p>
                When leaving from the Stream Party, all participants tried to first leave from the regular exit button
                in
                the top right corner of the screen, when a video is playing. Notably, one participant saw that there was
                an
                option to exit from the participants panel, but misinterpreted the function of the button.
            </p>

            <p>“I assume that End Session will end it for everyone, so I’m just gonna exit out of that.”</p>

            <p>
                Another thing that many participants had trouble with was figuring out how to host a Stream Party. One
                needed guidance, and tried clicking the button that would make one join a Stream Party, which wouldn’t
                work
                to create one. It should be noted, however, that this participant stated that they never use Netflix on
                mobile, so may be very unfamiliar with the fact that users need to click on something to watch to bring
                up
                the information on it, and can actually play the content from this window.
            </p>

            <p>
                “Once I was into the play section–like the choose your movie section, it did make sense, it was
                immediately
                once I was there, to find how to start it. But knowing to choose the movie before starting it was
                difficult.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Another participant who ranked themself as very familiar with Netflix’s interface had much less trouble
                navigating to the page that would grant them access to the button that would allow them to start a
                Stream
                Party.
            </p>

            <p>
                “There are two options that immediately come to mind–one is that I go to a show, and share it. The
                second
                option is to press on the same button as last time.”
            </p>

            <p>
                “The only thing that was ambiguous was on the homepage, where there were the two buttons, on the top
                right.
                I’ve seen the other one, which I assumed was Airplay.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Participants thought that once on the information page for a show or movie, finding the button to start
                a
                Stream Party was very easy to find, and said that it was intuitive.
            </p>

            <p>
                There were no problems with participants figuring out how to kick other users from the stream, starting
                a
                stream as a host, or finding the participants tab. Ending the stream was similar as well, since the
                users
                already knew how to exit streams from navigating the guest side of the interface.
            </p>

            <p>
                When prompted for suggestions, one participant said that they were unsatisfied with the pop-ups in the
                interface, and said that a full-screen overlay would be better.
            </p>

            <p>
                “The only thing I thought was inconsistent was the end session button, and it popped up over the
                existing
                screen share section? [...] The way it popped up over the existing things, I thought was messy.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Another participant said that making the Stream Party button on the home page would be useful. Notably,
                this
                same participant stated earlier in the testing that one thing they liked a lot about Netflix was the
                fact
                that their buttons were obvious.

            <p>
                As a follow-up, when questioned on the obviousness of the button, and whether or not text would be
                useful to
                include, they expressed confidence that adding text would not be necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
                “It’s a pretty good universal symbol, with a little crowd of people. It’s the only time Netflix would
                use an
                icon like that, so I think it makes sense without any text.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Another participant praised the fact that the Stream Share button for a host was accessible from outside
                the
                stream.
            </p>

            <p>
                “I like the fact that there’s a button to do the stream before you start playing [the movie]. I like
                that
                you can start the stream at the same time, or before. I thought that was really nice and really
                thoughtful.”
            </p>

            <h3>Future Directions:</h3>

            <p>
                To move forward in the future, the next steps would consider the participant feedback and edit the
                interface
                as necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
                One thing that should be done for the future would be to make the home screen easier to navigate. That
                is to
                say, finding the Stream Party button to join a stream should be made easier, so users will be able to
                find
                it better. The icon is fairly intuitive, as noted by participants, so the icon does not need much
                changing.
                However, possibly making the Stream Party more obvious on the interface (like the play button) or
                putting it
                in the bottom navigation bar may make it significantly easier to find.
            </p>

            <p>
                Regarding the problem related to having trouble finding the option to start a Stream Party, and the fact
                that participants would first be inclined to try clicking the button to join a Stream Party when trying
                to
                find a way to host: it may be worthwhile to add additional text on the screen when the join dialogue
                pops
                up, explaining how to start your own Stream Party. This way, users will get instructions when they
                navigate
                to the only other Stream Party-related button they know, if they try to click it to start their own
                Stream
                Party.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since a participant misinterpreted the exit function in the participants tab once the stream has
                started, it
                may be best to get rid of this alternative way to exit. There may not be a need to have two different
                ways
                to exit or stop a stream, and simplifying the process so it is consistent with the usual way people exit
                watching a show would be best.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, regarding the pop-ups, it may be best to get rid of them. After the testing, upon further
                review,
                the Netflix mobile app doesn’t actually use pop-ups. Therefore, introducing them may not align with
                Netflix’s design guidelines. Instead, the pop-ups should be replaced with other ways that Netflix brings
                up
                sub-menu options.
