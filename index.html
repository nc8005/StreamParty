            <h1>Shared Streaming Feature for Netflix</h1>

                Figma Lo-Fi Prototype (hw2)
            </a>
		
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Netflix no longer wants to support third-party apps for shared streaming. They want to design their own, native feature where users can start a host session, and invite friends to watch a show at the same time. This way, users won’t have to download third-party apps and be forced to trust other bootleg companies with their data. In addition, Netflix wants to discourage the sharing of accounts by multiple people, and wish to encourage subscription purchases by offering the feature only to those with their own, separate paid account.</p>
        
            <h3>The Team</h3>
            <p>Our team is a two-person cross-functional team, hired by Netflix to design a new feature into their mobile app to support cross-platform Netflix stream sharing. We value usability and satisfaction, and both team members work as a combination of mobile UI &amp; UX designers and front-end developers to design this new Netflix proposal.</p>
            
            <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
            <p>Our stakeholders are Netflix, one of the streaming giants that have recently started seeing muchy more competition with the introduction of more streaming services offered by other companies. They want to get a leg-up on the competition, by not only offering exclusive and well-demanded content, but by also offering services and features that are unavailable for other streaming platforms.</p>
            
            <h3>Consumers</h3>
            <p>Our consumers would be Netflix users, specifically those that want to enjoy the streaming services offered by Netflix with friends and loved ones, even when apart. This consumer need has become more apparent with the ongoing pandemic, and everyone should get the chance to watch their favorite shows together, while also staying safe. Even outside of the pandemic, a lot of Netflix users, young ones especially, already like to stream video content with friends and loved ones (screen sharing, third-party extensions); offering a sharing service native to Netflix would be an easier and more convenient way to do the same thing, given that the demand is already present.</p>
            
            <h3>Problem Analysis</h3>
            <p>Our prototype would be able to figure out how users should be able to interact with the new sharing service on a mobile platform, and find out the easiest and most clear method to achieve their intended goals. While Netflix may already have chosen the design for this feature for their web application, a mobile version often requires different users needs and goals specific to a smaller device. A complete prototype would showcase the user flow and demonstrate how a user will effectively and efficiently interact with the new feature on mobile.</p>
            
            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The design/prototype for Stream Party will be integrated on Netflix's mobile application.</li>
                <li>A button called “Stream Party” will be added to the main Netflix UI. One will be in the form of an icon in the top right corner, next to where the icon to mirror the device screen is; when clicked, users can choose to join a Stream Party session. The second way one can access the Stream Party is through a button added to the movie menu, in which there will be an option to host a Stream Party, right under the Download button.</li>
                <li>Once a session is started, the “Host” user gets a code that they can share with friends, which can be used to enter a Host’s Stream Party.</li>
                <li>The Host also has the option to share the code via text message, email, and other social media, for ease of sharing.</li>
                <li>Once the session is started, the “Stream Party” icon slightly changes/glows, which lets the Host user know they are currently hosting the session.</li>
                <ul><li>When the host chooses a video to stream, it is then streamed to all of the Guests in the current Stream Party session.</li></ul>
                <li>Users wanting to join a session become “Guest” users.</li>
                <li>Once a Guest has joined a session (and the Host has not started a video), they will be directed to the “waiting room” where they see the list of other users in the Stream Party and wait for a show/movie to play.</li>
                <li>If a Guest joins a session while a video is already playing, they will be immediately directed to the shared video with the rest of users.</li>
                <li>A user must have a paid Netflix subscription to host or join a session.</li>
                <li>One user at a time, aka the “Host”, can control the play/pause buttons, scrubbing, and which shows/movies to watch.</li>
                <li>A “Stream Party” button will also be added to the video UI, where a user can host/join a session there, or, if already in a session:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Host and Guest users can view a list of the current users in the Stream Party at any time.</li>
                    <li>A Guest user can request permission to become the host.</li>
                    <li>The Host user can give their host permissions to another Guest user at any given time.</li>
                    <li>The Host user can kick anyone out of the session.</li>
                    <li>Any Guest can leave the session with this button, and the Host can end the session with this button.</li>
                </ul>
